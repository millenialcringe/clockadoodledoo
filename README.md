Google's in-browser timer works fine, but lacks simple features that could make it more robust:

- room for multiple timers
- saved timers (browser caching)
- custom names for timers
- organizing timers
- export/import timers
- custom timer tab names
- desktop and mobile functionality

This runs purely in your browser tab, so no download is required. Additionally, your timers are saved in the cache. Be sure to <<export them>> before clearing!
